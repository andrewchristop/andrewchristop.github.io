        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>AAUW is a non-profit group that promotes educational and
            equity issues for women and girls. In 1881, Marion Talbot
            and Ellen Swallow Richards invited 15 woman alumnae
            representing eight different colleges to join them at an
            assemblage in Boston, Massachusetts (“AAUW: Who We
            Are,” 2015). The purpose of this meeting was to found an
            organization for women college graduates to foster
            opportunities for other women to attend college. Since this
            initial gathering, AAUW has grown to the point that AAUW
            has branches in all 50 states plus the District of Columbia,
            Guam and Puerto Rico. AAUW members advocate
            educational, social, economic, and political positions that
            benefit women. For example, AAUW was instrumental in
            the passage of Title IX that bans sex discrimination in any
            federally funded education program including collegiate
            athletics. There are approximately 170,000 active members
            
            who are affiliated through approximately 1,000 local
            branches throughout the United States and its territories
            (“AAUW: Membership,” 2015).</p>
